Project Preview

Description
Foresight Predictions is a decentralized prediction market platform where users can create, trade, and track outcomes of real-world events using blockchain technology. It allows participants to stake tokens on predictions across categories like crypto, sports, politics, and tech. Creators can launch their own markets with customizable parameters and earn fees from participation. Users connect their wallets to invest, monitor portfolios, and earn rewards for accurate predictions. The platform promotes transparency, fairness, and community-driven forecasting through smart contracts

Project Information
It solves the problem of centralized and biased prediction systems by enabling transparent, trustless forecasting through blockchain.
Users no longer rely on intermediaries to manage bets or results, everything is verified by smart contracts.
It also provides a secure way to monetize insights and crowdsource real-time predictions on global events.
In short, it replaces trust in people with trust in code.

How It Works
Users connect their crypto wallets to access the platform and join or create prediction markets.
Each market is powered by smart contracts that automatically lock funds, record trades, and distribute rewards based on verified outcomes.
Participants stake tokens on “Yes” or “No” outcomes, and once the event concludes, the contract releases payouts to the correct side.
This ensures transparency, fairness, and instant settlement without any human interference.

Target Group
The targeted audience includes crypto enthusiasts, traders, data analysts, and developers interested in decentralized finance (DeFi) and prediction markets.
It also appeals to researchers, investors, and communities who want transparent, bias-free forecasting tools.
Essentially, anyone who loves predicting real-world events or wants to earn from accurate insights is part of the target audience.went
